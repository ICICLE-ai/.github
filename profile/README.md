# Overview
Led by The Ohio State University, the National Science Foundation funded AI institute for Intelligent Cyberinfrastructure with Computational Learning in the Environment (ICICLE) will build the next generation of Cyberinfrastructure to render Artificial Intelligence (AI) more accessible to everyone and drive its further democratization in the larger society.
The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) fueling advances in science, education, and commerce has been driven not only by the ability to aggregate data from a wide range of sources, but also by the availability of increasingly powerful Cyberinfrastructure (CI) supporting AI advances. As CI becomes more complex and heterogeneous, end users of the technology face a bewildering set of choices in applying AI to leverage insightful analytics, modeling complex systems, or enabling automation.
